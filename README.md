# cvd-algorithm-test
a test of the algorithm designed to allow users with CVD to see better

# the algorithm
```step-1``` grab RGB data from original image - IMPLEMENTED

```step-2``` convert to LMS stimulus - IMPLEMENTED

```step-3``` apply required preparatory equations as mentioned in "An Interface to Support Color Blind Computer Users"

```step-4``` obtain the difference dC between original image and CVD-simulated image

```step-5``` use said difference with a modifying matrix A as obtained using modular arithmetic equation

```step-6``` convert corrected LMS stimulus to RGB

```step-7``` write to file

```end```
